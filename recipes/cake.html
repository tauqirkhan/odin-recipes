    <h2 class="h2">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour
        </li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda
        </li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt
        </li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened
        </li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar
        </li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar, packed
        </li>
        <li>2 large eggs
        </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract
        </li>
        <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
        </li>
        <li>1 cup chopped nuts (optional, such as walnuts or pecans)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="h2">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="list">
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Ensure the oven rack is positioned in the center.
        </li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt until well combined. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.
        </li>
        <li>Beat in the eggs, one at a time, ensuring each is fully incorporated before adding the next. Add the vanilla extract and mix until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing just until the flour is incorporated. Be careful not to overmix.
        </li>
        <li>Gently fold in the semisweet chocolate chips and chopped nuts (if using), distributing them evenly throughout the cookie dough.
        </li>
        <li>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto ungreased baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart. You can also use a cookie scoop for uniform sizes.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are set but the centers are still soft. The cookies will continue to firm up as they cool.
        </li>
        <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.
        </li>
        <li>Once cooled, enjoy your homemade Double Chocolate Chip Cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!
        </li>
