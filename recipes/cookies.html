    <ul>
        <li>3 cups butternut squash puree (cooked and mashed)
        </li>
        <li>24 ounces cream cheese, softened
        </li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar
        </li>
        <li>1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
        </li>
        <li>4 large eggs
        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract
        </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
        </li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
        </li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
        </li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 325°F (163°C) and grease a 9-inch springform pan.
        </li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, sugar, and ground cinnamon. Press the mixture into
            the bottom of the prepared pan to form an even crust.
        </li>
        <li>Bake the crust in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove and allow it to cool while you prepare the
            filling.
        </li>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth. Add the butternut squash puree, granulated
            sugar, brown sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and salt. Mix until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>Pour the butternut squash cheesecake filling over the cooled crust, spreading it evenly.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 60-70 minutes or until the center is set. The edges should be slightly
            golden.
        </li>
        <li>Allow the cheesecake to cool in the pan, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight to set.
        </li>
        <li>Once chilled, remove from the springform pan, slice, and serve. Optionally, drizzle with caramel sauce, add
            a dollop of whipped cream, or sprinkle with chopped nuts for a delightful finish.
        </li>
        <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to
            cool completely.
        </li>
    </ol>
