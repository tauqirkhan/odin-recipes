    <h2 class="h2">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>1 and 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
        </li>
        <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
        </li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
        </li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
        </li>
        <li>1 and 3/4 cups granulated sugar
        </li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
        </li>
        <li>2 large eggs
        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract
        </li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="h2">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="list">
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line cupcake pans with paper liners for easy removal.
        </li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
            Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.
        </li>
        <li>Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each is fully incorporated. Add the vanilla extract and mix until
            well combined.
        </li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet ingredients, alternating with buttermilk. Begin and end
            with the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined.
        </li>
        <li>Divide the batter evenly among the prepared cupcake liners, filling each about two-thirds full.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake
            comes out clean. Remove from the oven and allow the cupcakes to cool in the pans for a few minutes before
            transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.
        </li>
        <li>In a saucepan, whisk together evaporated milk, sugar, egg yolks, and butter over medium heat. Cook and stir
            until the mixture thickens, about 10-12 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract, shredded
            coconut, and chopped pecans. Allow the frosting to cool to room temperature.
        </li>
        <li>Once the cupcakes are completely cooled, generously frost each cupcake with the coconut and pecan frosting.
        </li>
        <li>For added flair, garnish each cupcake with a sprinkle of shredded coconut and chopped pecans.
        </li>
    </ol>
